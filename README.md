# Fractals

Created fractal images in C using recursion.

In the program fractals, the user can enter a number between 1 to 7, and a different fractal will be generated for each input. Pressing q quits out of the program.  In the program gallery, the user can click on the image or press any key and a forest of different color and height trees will be created with recursion. 

The fractals were created using recursion, and images were created using those recursive functions. The graphics functions were given to us, and the goal of this project was to understand recursion better while familiarizing ourselves with graphics. This was one of the first projects I did that involved graphics.
