The program fractals.c is meant to create 7 different types of fractals. From the user's 
perspective, if the user presses a number key between 1 and 7, a different fractal will appear 
for each key. When the user presses the 'q' key, the program will exit. From the programmer's
perspective, this program contains 7 different function to create the 7 different fractals, 
and it also contains a function to draw squares and a function to draw triangles. It then 
uses a switch statement to switch between the different fractals when the user presses a key. 
Each fractal function uses recursion to create its image. I evaluated the program's correctness
by making sure that each fractal appeared correctly within the window. This does produce the 
correct results because when compared to the examples we were given, the fractals created in 
my program create similar results. There are not any cases where this program gives incorrect
results. 

The program gallery uses one of the fractals from above, and displays multiple different 
versions of that fractal. The one used in my gallery is the tree fractal. The angle between the
branches and the height of the tree are changes, and the position of the tree changes as well. 
It then displays 16 different trees, all of which are different colors.
